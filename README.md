A low/no-overhead accurate in-BEAM web response time graph, which stores P50, P90 and P99 for your phoenix server. To do this, it makes use of `dog_sketch`, an implementation of the DDSketch algorithm and data structure.

For more information on the underlying data structure and algorithm that this project uses, see [here](https://github.com/moosecodebv/dog_sketch).
